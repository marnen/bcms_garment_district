Wanna edit your BrowserCMS content blocks in Markdown instead of HTML? Add this module to your BrowserCMS installation!

This module provides a Markdown Block content type; eventually I hope to support Textile as well. [Maruku](https://github.com/bhollis/maruku) is used as the parser, so you've got access to anything it supports, including the [PHP Markdown Extra](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) goodies.
